<!--Block level elements: an element that takes up a block on a webpage. are selfish. They take up an entire row. They stretch across the width of a page.-->

<h1> HTML ELEMENTS</h1>
<p>MAIN ELEMENTS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Block : Selfish, takes entire block.
  </li>
  <li>Inline: Share, show up side by side.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attributes</h4>
 <p> go into the opening tag of a void element.</p>
<h5>2 types</h5>
<ul>
ID = unique identifier, use to identify a single element in the document, JS adheres to that rule.
class = can be repeated if you need it. a classification, if you will. allows to group different elements together.
</ul>


<h2> Common Elements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Heading: as the number gets bigger the heading gets smaller. i.e. (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)</li>
  <li>Paragraph : preferred way of showing large quantities of text to our users and customers. ARE ALSO BLOCK ELEMENTS i.e. (p)</li>
  <li>Break : i.e. (br) VOID elements, don't contain any elements </li>
  <li>Hard Rule: i.e. (hr) VOID element, creates a line  </li>
  <li>INLINE elements: like em- emphasize  tag, turn the text italic & strong tag  is going to bold the font. </li>
  <li> nested elements of this is inside of the body. </li>
  <li> Unordered list: (ul) should contain a list element (li) & will have bullet points without the (li) we don't get the bullet point.</li>
  <li> Ordered List: (ol) Will contain numbers  </li>
  <li>Anchor Tags: INLINE ELEMENTS: Link tags, are how we link our webpage to take you to another one (a) contains a required tag. Has to contain https (hyper text transfer protocol secure) in order to link it. example : href = "https://www.google.com/" </li>
