      <dt>
        <strong>Are there any restaurants or food vendors in the park?</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Everglades National Park provides a limited variety of snack foods and
        beverages that are sold at the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center bookstore,
        at the Royal Palm Visitor Center bookstore, at the Flamingo marina store
        and at the Gulf Coast Visitor Center store. Everglades Guest Services
        also has a food truck located in Flamingo. However, we recommend that
        all visitors bring their own food and beverages during their stay at the
        park.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>Why isn't that alligator moving, is it dead or fake?</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        During your visit to Everglades National Park, you may see an alligator
        or a crocodile basking, laying out in the sun absorbing its heat, on the
        side of a trail or road. All reptiles, including alligators and
        crocodiles, absorb heat from the environment instead of creating their
        own heat like mammals and birds do. Because alligators and crocodiles
        are so big, it takes longer for their bodies to reach desired body
        temperatures than for smaller reptiles. They may not move for hours, but
        don’t worry, they are fine. You should never assume an animal in
        Everglades National Park is hurt, dead, or fake. The only statue of an
        animal in the park is that of a Florida panther outside the Ernest F.
        Coe Visitor’s Center. Additionally, hurt and even dead animals can be
        dangerous to touch or handle. Just because an alligator or crocodile may
        appear lethargic does not mean that it cannot quickly resume activity to
        defend itself. Though most would rather flee than attack, alligators and
        crocodiles are wild animals whose behavior is unpredictable.
        <strong>
          Keep a safe distance when viewing wildlife in the park (15 to 20 feet;
          4.5 to 6 meters) and do not harass or feed wildlife.</strong
        >
        <br />
        Alligators and crocodiles have plenty of natural food here and do not
        seek out humans or pets. However, do not mimic prey-like behavior which
        may attract these animals. Stay a safe distance from the shoreline (15
        to 20 feet; 4.5 to 6 meters) and do not swim, snorkel, or dive where
        prohibited - in any canal, pond, freshwater lake, marked channel, or
        boat basin inside the park. Prevent small children and pets from
        approaching shorelines or basking alligators or crocodiles. Feeding or
        harassing alligators is a criminal offense as it can ultimately result
        in harm to the alligator, humans, or both. Alligators that have been fed
        by humans associate people with food and may exhibit more aggressive
        behavior around humans.

      <dt><strong>Where can I take my pet in the park?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Pets are allowed (6-foot (2 m) leash) in parking lots and frontcountry
        campgrounds, but not on trails, in backcountry campsites, or in
        wilderness areas. Currently pets are only permitted in the following
        areas: <br />
        -On roadways open to public vehicular traffic <br />
        -In frontcountry campgrounds and picnic areas (Flamingo and Long Pine
        Key) <br />
        -On maintained ground surrounding public facilities <br />
        -Aboard boats
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Are there airboat tours inside the park?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Yes. There are three authorized airboat businesses inside Everglades
        National Park. All three are located along the Tamiami Trail
        (Coopertown, Everglades Safari Park, and Gator Park).
      </dd>
      <dt><strong> Is fishing allowed?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Yes, fishing is allowed inside the park. A Florida fishing license is
        required, unless you are under 16 years of age or you are a Florida
        resident over the age of 65. These licenses can be purchased at bait and
        tackle shops, at Wal-Mart or in-town. They can also be purchased online
        at www.myfwc.com or by calling 888-FISH-FLO (305-347-4356). Along the
        Main Park Road (accessed through the city of Homestead), Nine Mile Pond
        is the dividing line between saltwater and freshwater. If fishing at
        Nine Mile Pond and north of Nine Mile Pond, a freshwater fishing license
        is required. Anywhere south of Nine Mile Pond, a saltwater fishing
        license is required. For fishing at Gulf Coast (in Everglades City), a
        saltwater fishing license is required. Florida fishing regulations apply
        to our park, but with a few exceptions. Stop by our Visitor Center or
        download our Everglades National Park fishing regulations for more
        information. Visitors can get a tide table from the entrance station,
        the Gulf Coast Visitor Center, or the Flamingo Visitor Center.

      <dd>
        Swimming/Snorkeling is <strong> prohibited in all </strong>canals,
        ponds, freshwater lakes, marked channels, and boat basins inside the
        park.

    <h3>Biscayne National Park Florida</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authorized as Biscayne National Monument in 1968 (with a boundary change
        in 1974), it became a national park in 1980
      </li>
      <li>
        More than 10,000 years ago, the first people who came to Biscayne Bay
        were the Paleo-Indians.
      </li>
      <li>
        Biscayne was the headquarters for the notorious Pirate Black Caesar. He
        was a powerful African pirate who roamed the Caribbean in the early 18th
        century.
      </li>
      <li>There are at least 44 shipwrecks in park waters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dry Tortugas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Accessible only by boat or seaplane, the park is known the world over as
        the home of magnificent Fort Jefferson, picturesque blue waters,
        superlative coral reefs and marine life, and the vast assortment of bird
        life that frequents the area.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fort Jefferson National Monument was designated by President Franklin D.
        Roosevelt under the Antiquities Act on January 4, 1935.
      </li>
      <li>
        The seven keys (Garden, Loggerhead, Bush, Long, East, Hospital, and
        Middle) collectively known as the Dry Tortugas, are situated on the edge
        of the main shipping channel between the Gulf of Mexico, the western
        Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean.
      </li>
      <li>
        The strategic location of the Dry Tortugas brought a large number of
        vessels through its surrounding waters as they connect the Atlantic
        Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Early on, the shipping channel was used
        among Spanish explorers and merchants traveling along the Gulf Coast.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Timucuan Ecological & Historic Preserve Florida</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Located just outside Jacksonville, along the St. John’s River in North
        Florida, this park covers 46,000 acres of wetland marsh, tidal
        waterways, and upland forest habitat.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Timucua were a group of Native Americans who lived in current-day
        southern Georgia and northern Florida.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Where the Waters Meet” is what the indigenous peoples called it. The
        Nassau and St Johns River join to make one of the largest saltwater
        estuaries.
      </li>
      <li>
        A sanctuary for wildlife, it first became a vacation destination in 1875
        when John Rollins built the Fort George Island Hotel.
